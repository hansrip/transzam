# # Populate this file with data to be loaded by your ORM's *:data-load task.
# # You can create multiple files in this directory (i.e. 010_users.yml,
# # 020_articles.yml, etc) which will be loaded in alphabetical order.

# # See documentation for your ORM's *:data-load task for more information.

#
# This is the first non working fixture. Problems with child relations between
# various tables like parent Province and child District. Instead of using this
# fixture a concrete fixture was created via MySQL. This fixture named
#      <date>_transzam.yml
# has hard coded id's and created_at/modified_at dates.
# TODO : Find out why this construction doesn't work with doctrine:data-load.
